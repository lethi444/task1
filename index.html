        Mahendra Singh Dhoni, one of the most dynamic captain on the field , personalitytruly adore.HE is known by the number <mark>7</mark>
         Dhoni is known as one of the best ODI captain the game of cricket has seen and will forever be for very long 
          Some of his decisions on the field will make you scratch your 
           People think he is person who always follow his instincts, 
           makes decision by his gut feelings and what not but in my opinion he is the better observer of the game</p>
           <p>Under Dhoni's captaincy, India won the<MARK>2007</MARK>International Cricket Council (ICC) World Twenty20, the Commonwealth Bank
             Series of <mark>2007to 2008</mark>, the 2010 Asia Cup,
            the <mark>2011</mark>ICC Cricket World Cup and the <mark>2013 </mark> ICC Champions Trophy.</p>
            

            <p>On numerous occasions, Mahi single handedly won matches for India. He has been amongst
                 the ICC top <mark>10</mark> batsmen in ODIs for past any years and is a tremendous and 
                 an extra-ordinary finisher of the game. A team leader should be able to lead by example especially when the team

                needs the most. No one can forget the inning played by MSD in <mark>2011</mark> World Cup Final at Wankhede, Mumbai.
                 He rose up to the occasion and played decisive role in the victory.</p>
